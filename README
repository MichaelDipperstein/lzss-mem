DESCRIPTION
-----------
This archive contains an ANSI C library implementing bitwise reading and
writing of arrays.  This library is intended to provide functionality analogous
to my bit file library (https://michaeldipperstein.github.io/bitlibs.html).
Rather than building the library for optimal array usage, the library has been
built for bit order compatibility with my bit file library.

FILES
-----
arraystream.c   - Library implementing bitwise reading and writing of arrays
arraystream.h   - Header for arraystream library.
COPYING         - GNU General Public License v3
COPYING.LESSER  - GNU Lesser General Public License v3
Makefile        - makefile for this project (assumes gcc compiler and GNU make)
README          - this file
sample.c        - Program demonstrating how to use the arraystream library.

BUILDING
--------
To build these files with GNU make and gcc:
1. Windows users should define the environment variable OS to be Windows or
   Windows_NT.  This is often already done.
2. Enter the command "make" from the command line.

USAGE
-----
sample.c demonstrates usage of each of the arraystream functions.

HISTORY
-------
12/05/04 - Initial release
08/26/07 - Released under LGPL v3

TODO
----
- Consider implementing a version of this library with array boundary checking.
